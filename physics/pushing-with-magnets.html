<h1>Pushing with Magnets</h1>
  
<p>
  In this project, the hypothesis <b>can magnets can be used to ‘push’ magnetic nanoparticles?</b> was examined.  
  Python code was developed to calculate the magnetic field of a certain setup and was dependent on parameters such as distance between magnets and their
  relative rotations. Experimental analysis was then conducted to determine the code's accuracy. 
</p>
<p>
  It was found that at higher rotation angles the code was more
  accurate. This was likely due to minor defects in the magnets’ profiles that were exacerbated at further distances; also at such distances, the magnetic
  field changed relatively slowly, making it challenging to locate an exact minimum.
