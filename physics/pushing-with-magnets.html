<p>In this project, the hypothesis "can magnets can be used to ‘push’ magnetic nanoparticles?" was examined.  
  Python code was developed to calculate the magnetic field of a certain setup and was dependent on parameters such as distance between magnets and their
  relative rotations. Experimental analysis was then conducted to determine the code's accuracy. It was found that at higher rotation angles the code was more
  accurate. This was likely due to minor defects in the magnets’ profiles that were exacerbated at further distances; also at such distances, the magnetic
  field changed relatively slowly, making it challenging to locate an exact minimum.
