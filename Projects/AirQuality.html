	Since the 1990s there has been a push towards improving the natural ventilation of buildings. A well ventilated building is necessary to reduce build-up of harmful indoor air pollutants and excess moisture; poor ventilation has been shown to reduce both productivity of quality of life (Hou, J. et al. 2021, Apte, M.G. et al. 2000). 
  <br><br>
For this project, I was given a low cost air quality monitor that recorded various atmospheric concentrations such as CO2, VOC and PM10, where readings were taken every 5 minutes. To begin with, I just left the monitor running for a few days to see if anything interesting showed in the data. 
    <br><br>
I found that overnight while I was asleep, the CO2 concentrations seemed to level out – suggesting a steady state had been reached between my respiration rate and the room’s ventilation rate. What was interesting was that the steady state occurred at different CO2 levels each night.

	I hypothesised that the reason for the variations in steady-state levels were to do with external, environmental conditions, such as wind speed, outdoor temperature or humidity. I found a paper (Linden, P.F. 1999) that backed this up – stating ventilation is mainly driven by wind speed– and so I decided to see if I could demonstrate a link between wind speed and my room’s ventilation rate.
	      <br><br>
The Air Change Rate (ACR) of a room can be calculated using just CO2 concentrations and is equivalent to ventilation rate. I found another paper (Batterman, S. 2017) that defined equations to find the ACR of room in three different scenarios...

     <b>1. Build Up</b>
	<br>
	   1 occupant enters the room after being outside long enough for the concentration to almost reach atmospheric concentrations.
   </div>
   <div class="firstthree">
     <b>2. Steady State</b>
	<br>
	   1 occupant asleep in the room, CO2 concentrations level out for over one hour (varies by less than 50ppm).
   </div>
   <div class="firstthree">
     <b>3. Decay</b>
	<br>
	   After a period of high CO2 concentration the occupant leaves the room with the window closed.
