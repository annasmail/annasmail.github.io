	  Graphs are introduced to students from an early age and are used across many subjects as a helpful way to organize and understand information. Because of this, they can seem simple or obvious. But the development of graphs as a concept actually took centuries and involved some of the most influential thinkers in history. When we look at the natural world, there’s nothing immediately mathematical about what we see—turning those observations into abstract ideas like graphs was a major intellectual achievement.
      </div>
<div class="textnorm">
    The mathematization of nature had been around since the likes of Pythagoras, Plato and Archimedes, where they looked at subjects such as astronomy, optics and balance. At this point, motion was regarded as one of four kinds of changes, laid out by <b>Aristotle (384–322 BC)</b>:

  <div class="image" style="aspect-ratio: 195/40; background-image: url('../images/graphs-01.png');">
  </div>

  <div class="textnorm">
    These changes weren’t seen as mathematical like astronomy; the change of sickness to health could not be ‘modelled’. Aristotle thought that motion was analogous to a quality of an object; like heat, an object could have a varying <b>strength of motion</b>. His work, <i>Physics</i>, shows the first use of distance and time as measurements of motion and he describes the ‘quickness’ of an object, although it largely remained a vague, unquantifiable concept. 
    <br><br>
    Much later on, between 1325 and 1350, scholars at <b>Oxford’s Merton College</b> were developing a technical vocabulary for dealing with motion. They had distinguished between dynamic and kinematic motion, and also between uniform and nonuniform motion, but explained their thoughts verbally – the advantages of geometric analysis were still to be recognised.

  <div class="textnorm">
    Velocity as a concept is abstract and not immediately obvious. Up until the end of the middle ages, time-keeping devices were poor, meaning that motion wasn’t exactly measurable. The Merton scholars had created the Merton Rule stating that a body moving at <b>uniform acceleration</b> moves the <b>same distance</b> in a given time as it would moving at a uniform speed equal to the average speed of the uniform acceleration. In reality, the scholars couldn’t find an object that would move at uniform acceleration; the whole study was an abstract endeavour – but <i>if</i> a uniformly accelerated object were to exist, it <i>would</i> follow the Merton rule.

  <subheading>What is the intensity of a quality?</subheading>

  <div class="textnorm">
    The Merton scholars also made a clearer distinction between quality of quantity than that of Aristotle:

  </div>

  <div class="textnorm">
    The concept of an intensity of a quality is ultimately what led to the creation of graphs. At the University of Paris, <b>Nicole Oresme (1323 – 1382)</b> took the first step. Line segments had previously been used as a way of representing the magnitude of a quality (twice the length = twice the intensity of a quality). Oresme looked at a metal rod and thought about the temperature profile throughout it if it were heated just at one end. He drew the rod horizontally and then <b>extended line segments vertically upwards</b> to represent the temperature of the rod at that point. He noted that if there were a uniform warming throughout the rod, there would be a <b>uniform lengthening</b> of the rods as well.

  <div class="image" style="aspect-ratio: 165/48; background-image: url('../images/graphs-03.png');">
  </div>

  <div class="textnorm">
    Oresme went on to make this representation even more abstract, first replacing the ‘rod’ with a horizontal line to create a <b>general system</b> that could be used to represent any subject, not just distance. He moved on to motion, first looking at the velocity along a rod that was rotating around a point. This fitted well with the previous diagram he had made, now plotting <b>velocity against distance</b>:
  </div>


  <div class="image" style="aspect-ratio: 153/35; background-image: url('../images/graphs-04.png');">
  </div>

  <div class="textnorm">
    Next he looked at a body that moves as a single unit whose <b>velocity varies over time</b>. He decided that the subject – the horizontal line – could be time and the vertical would be intensity of the velocity at each time. This was the first suggestion of the coordinate system that is common throughout secondary school education today – allowing velocity to be plotted <b>as a function of time</b>. 
    <br><br>
    He went on to produce graphs of object’s velocities following uniform, uniformly-nonuniform and nonuniformly-nonuniform motion and identified that the distance traversed by the object is represented by the area under these figures. This understanding allowed him to geometrically prove the Merton rule.

    The purely conceptual construct became a new framework for <b>kinematics</b> and later became mainstream through the development of <b>modern mechanics by Galileo</b> in the seventeenth century!
