	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		A hard-working final year student who enjoys learning about the natural world. Throughout my degree I have gained an appreciation for a wide range of scientific topics and would like to build 
	upon this through further education in environmental modelling. I am a quick learner and like to use my creativity to personalise my academic projects.
