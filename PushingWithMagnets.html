	<h3>Magnets and medicine</h3>

<div class="grid-container">
	<div class="grid-item1">
  <p1> The use of magnets in medicine started around 70 years ago. In 1957, Gilchrist injected tumours with biocompatible, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and then used the particles’ magnetic property to heat them up. This successfully destroyed the metastases while not affecting the surrounding healthy tissue. 
  </p1>
  <p1>
Current research focuses on the use of <b>external</b> magnets to guide and trap drug-carrying MNPs. This has the promising ability to concentrate drugs at disease locations by pulling the MNPs towards the external magnet thereby minimising exposure of healthy tissues to potentially cytotoxic drugs.
  </p1>
  <p11>
There have been a number of studies looking at different magnetic configurations, each with varying abilities of manipulation of MNPs within anatomical structures.

	<h3>Fields and forces</h3>
</div>
			
<div class="grid-container5">
	<p1>MNPs will experience a force when they interact with a magnetic field. A force will always act in the direction of low to high magnetic field strength so, for example, in the single bar magnet seen above, the direction from low to high magnetic field strength will be towards the magnet as the field lines get denser towards the poles. 
<br> The exerted force from a single bar magnet on a spherical magnetic particle is given by the following equation,
</p1>
</div>

<div class="grid-container5">
	$$ {\small \overrightarrow{F}_{mag} = \frac{4 \pi a^3}{3} \frac{\mu_0 \chi}{(1+\frac{\chi}{3})} \left[\frac{\partial\overrightarrow{H}}{\partial\overrightarrow{x}}\right]^T \overrightarrow{H} = \frac{2 \pi a^3}{3} \frac{\mu_0 \chi}{(1+\frac{\chi}{3})} \nabla\left(||\overrightarrow{H}||^2\right) = k \nabla\left(||\overrightarrow{H}||^2\right)} \\$$
</div>
			
<div class="grid-container5">
	<p>where F is the magnetic <b>force</b>, χ is the magnetic susceptability, H is the magnetic <b>field</b>, μ is the vacuum permeability, a is the MNP diameter and x is distance from the magnet.<br> 
		Shapiro’s setup takes two identical bar magnets and rotates one by 180 degrees so that the north-south poles are oppositely oriented. They are then angled towards one another and bought closer, creating an overlap in their magnetic fields. <br>
		Magnetic fields are linear, so a magnetic field created by n number of magnets can be calculated by simply adding n number of terms of equation 1. For example, the overall force from two bar magnets can be found by adding together two terms. However, as we’ve rotated one of the magnets, we instead need to subtract.
