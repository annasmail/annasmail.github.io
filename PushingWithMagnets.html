	<h3>Magnets and medicine</h3>
</div>
      
<div class="grid-container">
	<div class="grid-item1">
  <p1> Magnets were first used for medicinal purposes around 70 years ago. In 1957, <a2 href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450524/">Gilchrist <i>et al.</i></a2> injected tumours with biocompatible, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The particles were then subjected to induction heating which successfully destroyed the metastases, while not affecting the surrounding healthy tissue. 
  </p1>
  <p1>
Current research focuses on the use of <b>external</b> magnets to guide and trap drug-carrying MNPs. This has the promising ability to concentrate drugs at disease locations by pulling the MNPs towards the external magnet thereby minimising exposure of healthy tissues to potentially cytotoxic drugs.
  </p1>
  <p11>
There have been a number of studies looking at different magnetic configurations, each with varying abilities to manipulate the MNPs within anatomical structures.

		<p5>Single-layered Array</p5><br>
		<p1>Two or more permanent magnets arranged in a single layer. The most simple and cost-effective setup.</p1>
	</div>
	<div class="grid-item24">
		<p5>Annular Halbach Arrays</p5><br>
		<p1>These have multiple layers of magnets which 'squeezes' the magnetic field and creates a greater magnetic field strength.</p1>
	</div>
	<div class="grid-item24">
		<p5>Tip-Top System</p5><br>
		<p1>An angular tip will concentrate the magnetic field, exerting a larger force on MNPs than bar magnets.</p1>

<div class="grid-container4">
	<div class="grid-item40">
	<p1>On a conventional magnetic field line diagram, closer field lines indicate a stronger magnetic field strength. A single bar magnet’s field and contour lines are shown below, where we can see that the contour-line density decreases away from the magnet, indicating the decay of the magnetic field strength with distance. 
		On the right is a plot of magnetic field strength versus distance from one of the magnet's poles. This decay over distance fits with what we would expect, based on the countour lines and field plot.</p1>

	<h3>Fields and forces</h3>
</div>
			
<div class="grid-container7">
<div class="grid-item71">
  <div class="grid-item711">
    <p1>MNPs will experience a force when they interact with a magnetic field. A force will always act in the direction of <b>low to high magnetic field strength</b> so in the case of the single bar magnet seen above, the direction from low to high magnetic field strength will be <b>towards</b> the magnet as the field lines get denser towards the poles. </p1>
 </div>
  <div class="grid-item711">
    <p1> The exerted force from a single bar magnet on a spherical magnetic particle is given by the following equation, </p1>
$$ {\small \overrightarrow{F}_{mag} = \frac{4 \pi a^3}{3} \frac{\mu_0 \chi}{(1+\frac{\chi}{3})} \left[\frac{\partial\overrightarrow{H}}{\partial\overrightarrow{x}}\right]^T \overrightarrow{H} = \frac{2 \pi a^3}{3} \frac{\mu_0 \chi}{(1+\frac{\chi}{3})} \nabla\left(||\overrightarrow{H}||^2\right) = k \nabla\left(||\overrightarrow{H}||^2\right)} \\$$
<p1>where F is magnetic <b>force</b>, X is magnetic susceptability, H is magnetic <b>field</b>, u is vacuum permeability, a is MNP diameter and x is distance from the magnet.</p1> 
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item711">
    <p1>One single-layered array was suggested by Shapiro in 2010. Shapiro’s setup takes two identical bar magnets and rotates one by 180 degrees so that the north-south poles are oppositely oriented. They are then angled towards one another and bought closer, creating an overlap in their magnetic fields (shown above). </p1> 
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item711">
    <p1>Magnetic fields are <b>linear</b>, so a magnetic field created by <i>n</i> number of bar magnets can be calculated by simply adding <i>n</i> number of terms of the above equation. For example, the overall force from two bar magnets can be found by adding together two terms. However, as we’ve rotated one of the magnets, we instead need to <b>subtract</b> one from the other.</p1>
</div>
</div>
  <div class="grid-item73">
	  <div class="contentfade">
		<p>This field results from two magnets with the <b>same</b> orientation. It produces an even decay of magnetic field strength, similar to that of a single bar magnet.</p>
	  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item72">
	  <div class="contentfade">
		<p>This field results from two magnets with <b>different</b> orientations. The white spot at the top of the plot in <b>local minimum</b>.</p>
	  </div>
  </div>
<div class="grid-container0">
	<p>Looking at the oppositely oriented magnet plot, we can see that there is a light area in the magnetic field around at the top. This is known as a <b>local minimum</b> and is created by the two magnetic fields cancelling at that point. This local minimum gives us the ability to push with magnets; we know that a force will always act in the direction of low to high magnetic field strength, so if an MNP were to be placed slightly beyond this local minimum, the increase in magnetic field strength <b>away</b> from the magnet would <b>push</b> the MNP away from the magnet.</p>

	<h3>The project</h3>
</div>
<div class="grid-container0">
	<p>Typical research in this area starts with the development of a computer model that can calculate the magnetic field of a setup. These are then validated experimentally with magnets and a Hall Probe to measure their resultant field. This was the methodology that we aimed to replicate.</p>
