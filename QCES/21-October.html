        <h2>Permafrost Melting & CCS</h2>
        <p4>This week I read about the implications of permafrost melting and a bit about Carbon Capture & Storage - here's a summary!</p4>

    Melting permafrost
  </div>

<div class="widetext">
	<p>One of my lecturers mentioned permafrost this week and how its stability is so important in high latitude areas. 
	Permafrost is just land that is permanently frozen and is predominantly found in Arctic regions such as Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Russia.</p> 
	<p>These areas are <b>at risk of thawing due to rises in global temperatures</b> - scientists predict that there will be widespread thawing by 2100 â€“ 
	and this could have various serious implications.</p>
</div>
		
<div class="aside">
  <subsubtitle>Feedback Loops</subsubtitle>
	<p>Feedback loops are important systems in the climate, and the warming of areas with permafrost is a good example of one. 
	These areas cover around 25% of the Northern Hemisphere land masses and of all the organic carbon stored in soil globally, they hold around 50% of it!</p>
	<p>As it thaws, microbes can begin to break down the organic matter - this releases both <b>carbon dioxide</b> and <b>methane</b> into the atmosphere which is where 
	the feedback loop is created; the release of greenhouse gases leads to further warming and hence further melting. All of this to say that as 
	temperatures rise, the permafrost will continue to melt, meaning the implications discussed below will only become more prevalent. </p>

<div class="widetext">
Erosion:  Tuktoyakut Canada - Ice is a natural barrier against storm wave action so if it is melted, waves hit the coast directly and drives rapid erosion.
Destabilising landscapes and buildings: cyclical freezing and thawing mean that the soils contract and sink. This will destabilise whatever is above it (roads, railways, pipes, buildings). Russian Arctic Cities damaged. 
Flooding hazards and forced migration: Canadian housing crisis
Diseases: mercury and arsenic, ancient diseases. The thawing of permafrost may also release harmful bacteria and diseases that could harm Arctic ecosystems.
