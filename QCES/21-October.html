    Permafrost thaw
  </div>

<div class="widetext">
	<p>One of my lecturers mentioned permafrost this week and how its stability is so important in high latitude areas. 
	Permafrost is just land that is permanently frozen and is predominantly found in Arctic regions such as Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Russia.</p> 
	<p>These areas are <b>at risk of thawing due to rises in global temperatures</b> - scientists predict that there will be widespread thawing by 2100 â€“ 
	and this could have various serious consequences, such as...</p>

  <subsubtitle>Feedback Loops</subsubtitle>
	<p>Feedback loops are important systems to understand, and the warming of areas with permafrost is a good example of one. 
	These areas cover around 25% of the Northern Hemisphere land masses and of all the organic carbon stored in soil globally, they hold around 50% of it!</p>
	<p>As it thaws, microbes can begin to break down the organic matter - this releases both <b>carbon dioxide</b> and <b>methane</b> into the atmosphere which is where 
	the feedback loop is created; these greenhouse gases lead to further warming and subsequently further melting. So basically as 
	temperatures rise, the permafrost will continue to melt, meaning the consequences will only become more prevalent. </p>
</div>

<div class="widetext">
	<div class="img"  style=" background-image: url('../images/alaska-32.png');"></div>
<p> Flooding, erosion and land destabilisation have the net effect of <b>migration and relocation of Arctic communities</b>. As the frost thaws, soils are
	more susceptible to erosion meaning shorelines recede and settlements become prone to flooding. Also, the melting of sea ice means that coastal 
	areas are less protected against ocean storms.</p>
	<p>Not only that but the cyclical thawing and freezing from annual temperature variations means that 
	soil will <b>shrink and expand</b>. This causes buildings and infrastructure to become incredibly unstable. Some areas of Alaska have experienced erosion 
	rates greater than 20 meters a year - for example, around 300 former residents of the village <b>Newtok</b> have had to abandon their homes and relocate 
	elsewhere. </p>
	<p>The arctic animals and marine life are also being affected by the changes in temperature. For example, walruses are finding it difficult
	to secure food due to <b>lack of sea ice</b> and <b>fish migrating northwards</b> while polar bears struggle to find enough snow to build dens to give birth in.</p>

<div class="widetext">
<subsubtitle>Another interesting phenomenon...</subsubtitle>
<p> Craters began appearing in north-west Siberia which are said to be caused by subterranean gases and related to global warming. 
	The conditions causing these are not fully understood. The craters were up to 30m deep. The gas may have built up to their current pressure over 
	10s/100s/1000s of years from organic components partially decaying before freezing. Alternatively, methane trapped in an ice-like form (methane hydrates)
	could be reverting to its gaseous state, perhaps due to global warming. The rising pressure causes the gas pockets to burst. People have been close
	enough to hear the blast when they explode. </p>
