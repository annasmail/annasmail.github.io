    Melting permafrost
  </div>

<div class="widetext">
	One of my lecturers mentioned permafrost this week and how its stability is so important in high latitude areas. 
	Permafrost is just land that is permanently frozen and is predominantly found in Arctic regions such as Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Russia. 
	These areas are at risk of thawing due to rises in global temperatures - scientists predict that there will be widespread thawing by 2100 â€“ 
	and this could have various serious implications.

    Feedback Loops
  </div>
<div class="narrowtext">
	Feedback loops are important systems in the climate, and the warming of areas with permafrost is a good example of one. 
	These areas cover around 25% of the Northern Hemisphere land masses and of all the organic carbon stored in soil globally, they hold around 50% of it!
	As it thaws, microbes can begin to break down the organic matter - this releases both carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere which is where 
	the feedback loop is created; the release of greenhouse gases leads to further warming and hence further melting. All of this to say that as 
	temperatures rise, the permafrost will continue to melt, meaning the implications discussed below will only become more prevalent.
