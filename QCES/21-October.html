    Permafrost thaw
  </div>

<div class="widetext">
	<p>One of my lecturers mentioned permafrost this week and how its stability is so important in high latitude areas. 
	Permafrost is just land that is permanently frozen and is predominantly found in Arctic regions such as Greenland, Canada, Alaska and Russia.</p> 
	<p>These areas are <b>at risk of thawing due to rises in global temperatures</b> - scientists predict that there will be widespread thawing by 2100 – 
	and this could have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/30-arctic-ferris-paper.pdf">various serious consequences</a>, such as...</p>

  <subsubtitle>Feedback Loops</subsubtitle>
	<p>Feedback loops are important systems to understand, and the warming of areas with permafrost is a good example of one. 
	These areas cover around <a href="https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/permafrost-thaw-warming-world-arctic-institute-permafrost-series-fall-winter-2020/">25%</a> of the Northern Hemisphere land masses and of all the organic carbon stored in soil globally, they hold around 50% of it!</p>
	<p>As it thaws, microbes can begin to break down the organic matter - this releases both <b>carbon dioxide</b> and <b>methane</b> into the atmosphere which is where 
	the feedback loop is created; these greenhouse gases lead to further warming and subsequently further melting. So basically as 
	temperatures rise, the permafrost will continue to melt, meaning the knock-on effects will only become more prevalent. </p>
</div>

<div class="widetext">
	<div class="img"  style=" background-image: url('../images/alaska-32-32.png');"></div>
<p> Flooding, erosion and land destabilisation have the net effect of <b>migration and relocation of Arctic communities</b>. As the frost thaws, soils are
	more susceptible to erosion meaning shorelines recede and settlements become prone to flooding. Also, the melting of sea ice means that coastal 
	areas are less protected against ocean storms.</p>
	<p>Not only that but the cyclical thawing and freezing from annual temperature variations means that 
	soil will <b>shrink and expand</b>. This means that overlying buildings and infrastructure will become incredibly unstable. </p>
	<p>Some areas of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-permafrost-melting-alaska-newtok-relocation-moving-292694f057b75f75a9438c794853ee25">Alaska</a> have experienced erosion 
	rates greater than 20 meters a year - for example, around 300 former residents of the village <b>Newtok</b> have had to abandon their homes and relocate 
	elsewhere. </p>
	<p>The arctic animals and marine life are also being affected by the changes in temperature; walruses are finding it difficult
	to secure food due to <b>lack of sea ice</b> and <b>fish migrating northwards</b> while polar bears struggle to find enough snow to build dens to give birth in.</p>

<subsubtitle>Another interesting phenomenon...</subsubtitle>
<p> One interesting phenomenon I read about was the permafrost craters in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201130-climate-change-the-mystery-of-siberias-explosive-craters">Siberia</a>! From 2014 to 2020, 17 of these craters were discovered throughout the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas – 
	they’re massive holes up to <b>70m wide and 50m deep</b> that have unusually high levels of <b>methane concentrations</b> surrounding them. 
	Looking at satellite imagery, <a href="https://news.agu.org/press-release/new-yamal-craters-explanation/#:~:text=The%20case%20of%20the%20exploding%20permafrost&text=In%202014%2C%20reports%20emerged%20of,and%20the%20nearby%20Gydan%20Peninsula">researchers</a> were able to observe the areas prior to the craters being formed. They found that mounds were forming 
	and at some point an explosion took place where matter flew up to 300m away from the centre. </p>
	<p>The only explanation for such an explosion was a pressure build-up of gas beneath the ground – assumed to be methane due to the high concentrations around the craters. It was only recently 
	that researchers understood the process behind this build-up - a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL108987#:~:text=A%20significant%20volume%20of%20surface,with%20implications%20for%20the%20climate.">2024 study</a> described the process that is outlined in the diagrams below... </p>

<div class="phototext">Adapted from: 'New explanation for Siberia’s permafrost craters', AGU</div>
	
<div class="widetext">
<p> One component of the Siberian geology that is relatively unique, is its layers of methane hydrates and cryopegs. These structures come sandwiched together 
	and interspersed throughout the thick permafrost layer.  </p>
</div>

<div class="defin">
	<p><b>Methane hydrates</b> are methane molecules trapped within a cage of water molecules - they likely originate when organic matter breaks down. 
	<b>Cryopegs</b> are unfrozen, salty waters that are kept liquid due to the pressure and salinity - they lie on top the methane hydrates.</p>
</div>

<div class="widetext">
	<p>As shown in the diagrams, when permafrost begins to warm, meltwater makes its way down to the cryopegs, causing them to expand – thereby 
		building up pressure. This pressure results in cracks in soil and the <b>rapid depressurization</b> that comes with the cracking causes the 
		hydrates to decompose and release their methane gases – in a sudden, violent explosion. </p>
